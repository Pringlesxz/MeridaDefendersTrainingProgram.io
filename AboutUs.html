    <h1><b><br>History of Softball</h1></b>
    <h2>The earliest known softball game was played in Chicago, Illinois on Thanksgiving Day, 1887. 
        It took place at the Farragut Boat Club at a gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale University and 
        Harvard University football game.When the score was announced and bets were settled, a Yale alumnus 
        threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled up glove.
         George Hancock, a reporter there, called out "Play ball!" and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball,
          a broom handle serving as a bat. This first contest ended with a score of 41â€“40.[11] The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded.[</h2>
    <h2>George Hancock is credited as the game's inventor for his development of a 17" ball and an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, 
        which spread quickly to outsiders. Envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter, the sport was called "Indoor Baseball</h2>
    <H2>In 1895 Lewis Rober, Sr. of Minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise for firefighters; this game was known as kitten ball 
        (after the first team to play it), lemon ball, or diamond ball. Rober's version of the game used a ball 12 inches (30 cm) 
        in circumference, rather than the 16-inch (41 cm) ball used by the Farragut club, and eventually the Minneapolis ball prevailed,
         although the dimensions of the Minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of the Chicago one. 
         Rober may not have been familiar with the Farragut Club rules. Fire Station No. 19 in Minneapolis, Rober's post from 1896 to 1906,
          was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its association with the sport's development.
          The first softball league outside the United States was organized in Toronto in 1897.</H2>

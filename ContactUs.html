    <h1>What is Softball ?</h1>
          <h2>Softball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of 10 players. 
            It is a direct descendant of baseball although there are some key differences:
             softballs are larger than baseballs, and the pitches are thrown underhand rather 
             than overhand. Softball is played on a smaller diamond than in baseball.</h2>
          <h2>Despite the game’s name, the standard softball is not soft; in fact, it is harder than a baseball.</h2>
          <H2>Softball is played between 2 teams on a large field, with nine or ten players from one team on the field at a time. 
              There are 4 bases on the infield (first base, second base, third base and home plate). 
              Near the centre of this square is the pitcher’s circle, and within the circle is the “rubber”, 
              a small flat rectangular area.The object of the game is to score more runs (points) 
              than the other team by batting (hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases, touching 
              each one in succession. The ball is a sphere of light material, covered with leather or synthetic material.
               It is 10 to 12 inches in circumference.The game is officiated by one or more neutral umpires. 
               Players and umpires are generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is 
               not in play, or immediately following a play once its outcome is clear.</H2>
